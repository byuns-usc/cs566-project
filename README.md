### About
Many modern computer vision architectures leverage diffusion for its ease of feature extraction and generation. However, these models are often heavy due to their gradual noise generation and removal processes, negatively impacting their usability in power-limited edge devices. In this paper, we show diffusion models can be reduced to 1D convolution architecture without significantly impacting the accuracy while increasing deployability. We propose to make a move toward a lighter diffusion pipeline that only requires 1D calculations by generating semantic segmentation masks with only channel-wise 1D convolutions. In many state-of-the-art super-resolution methods, PixelShuffle operations have been proven to increase accuracy while decreasing computational overhead. Following suit, SegOne incorporates PixelShuffle operations into diffusion to effectively capture spatial relations without 2D kernels. Although we mainly focus on MRI image segmentation for the sake of specialization, the proposed method is also rigorously tested against 2D convolution UNet baselines with varying depths, evaluated on multiple datasets such as COCO, NYUv2, and Diode.
